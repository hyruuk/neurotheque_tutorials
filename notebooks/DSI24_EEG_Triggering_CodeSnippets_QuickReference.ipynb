    "This file provides **ready-to-use** Python functions for sending triggers to the **DSI-24** EEG system, with minimal commentary. For detailed explanations (e.g., **tonic** vs. **phasic** or **immediate** vs. **on-flip** timing), please refer to the **Concepts** document. For a full implementation example (such as a Go/No-Go task in PsychoPy), see the corresponding **Implementation** document.\n",

For example, if you have a **long block** representing a particular task condition, you might use a **tonic** trigger to mark that entire interval. Meanwhile, you can embed **phasic** triggers at precise moments (stimulus onset, response detection) within that block.\n",

    "Imagine a __2-minute__ “Task” block followed by a __1-minute__ “Rest” block. At the start of __“Task”__ you set a tonic trigger (e.g., `5`) to denote that block in your EEG data. Every time a stimulus appears, you send a __phasic__ trigger (e.g., `10`) aligned with stimulus onset. At the end of “Task,” you reset the tonic trigger, then set a different tonic trigger for __“Rest”__ (e.g., 6). This way:\n",

    "1. __Initialize Early__\n",
    "\n",
    "    Open the serial port (e.g., `ser = serial.Serial('COM3'))` at the start of your experiment. Reset the line to 0 to avoid stray triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Use Named Constants__\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define triggers like `GO_STIM_ONSET = 10` or `TASK_START = 50` for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Respect Hardware Constraints__\n",
    "\n",
    "    Many EEG amplifiers (including the DSI-24) require a minimum pulse width (e.g., 10 ms) for reliable trigger detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Test & Debug__\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use print/log statements to confirm the DSI-24 receives each trigger code as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
