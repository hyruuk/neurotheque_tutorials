    "# DSI-24 EEG Triggering: Concepts and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides an overview of **why** and **how** to send triggers when using the DSI-24 wireless EEG system. It covers the conceptual underpinnings of different trigger styles (tonic vs. phasic) and timing methods (immediate vs. on-flip), along with best practices for establishing a reliable serial connection and ensuring high-quality EEG event alignment.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In many EEG experiments, sending **event markers** (also called *triggers*) from your behavioral task software (e.g., **PsychoPy**) to the DSI-24 amplifier is crucial for synchronizing recorded brain signals with specific paradigm events (such as stimulus onsets, condition changes, or responses). Understanding the core concepts behind **tonic** and **phasic** triggers—and how to manage them in your experimental workflow—lays a solid foundation for accurate and meaningful EEG data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Background on DSI-24 and Triggering\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Hardware and Serial Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "The **DSI-24** system is a **wireless EEG headset** that can receive numeric trigger values via a **serial port** or other specialized I/O interface. Each numeric code is saved alongside the EEG data, allowing you to pinpoint the moment events occurred during later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Physical Connection**  \n",
    "  Typically, you connect your computer (running experiment software like PsychoPy) to the DSI-24’s data acquisition software (e.g., **DSI-Streamer**) through a **USB-to-serial** adapter or a dedicated trigger interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Finding Your COM Port**  \n",
    "  1. **Windows**:  \n",
    "     - Open **Device Manager** (Win+X → “Device Manager”).  \n",
    "     - Expand **“Ports (COM & LPT)”** and locate something like **“USB Serial Port (COMX)”**.  \n",
    "  2. **Linux**:  \n",
    "     - Plug in your device, then open a terminal: `dmesg | grep tty` to see the assigned port (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`).  \n",
    "  3. **macOS**:  \n",
    "     - Open **Terminal** and run `ls /dev/tty.*` or `ls /dev/cu.*` to find entries referencing `usbserial` or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing your device’s port name is essential before opening and configuring the serial connection in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Tonic vs. Phasic Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "Event markers (triggers) align EEG data with your task events. Two main styles are widely used in EEG experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Tonic (Sustained) Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**  \n",
    "  A **tonic** trigger is set to a nonzero value at the start of a block or event and remains at that value until it’s explicitly reset to zero.  \n",
    "- **When to Use**  \n",
    "  - **Long Blocks/States**: Great for extended intervals (e.g., multi-minute tasks).  \n",
    "  - **Neurofeedback/Closed-Loop**: Maintains a constant marker for real-time tracking.  \n",
    "- **Pros/Cons**  \n",
    "  - **Pros**: Easy to visualize in raw data; simpler for long durations.  \n",
    "  - **Cons**: Must remember to reset; less precise for capturing quick sub-events within a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Phasic (Brief) Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**  \n",
    "  A **phasic** trigger is a short pulse—often just 10–50 ms—turned on at a precise moment (like stimulus onset) and then turned off immediately.  \n",
    "- **When to Use**  \n",
    "  - **Discrete Stimulus Onsets**: Common in ERP studies (e.g., P300).  \n",
    "  - **Rapid-Fire Events**: Each short pulse stands alone.  \n",
    "- **Pros/Cons**  \n",
    "  - **Pros**: High temporal precision; reduces overlap between events.  \n",
    "  - **Cons**: Not ideal for extended conditions; must ensure hardware detects short pulses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Choosing the Right Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment Duration**:  \n",
    "  - **Tonic** for multi-second/minute intervals where a continuous marker is beneficial.  \n",
    "  - **Phasic** for short-lived events that need precise timing.  \n",
    "- **Analysis Goals**:  \n",
    "  - **ERP or Time-Locked** studies typically prefer **phasic**.  \n",
    "  - **Block-Based** or **Neurofeedback** typically prefer **tonic**.  \n",
    "- **Hybrid**: Many designs combine tonic markers for broad phases with phasic pulses for precise event onsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Immediate vs. On-Flip Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond deciding on tonic or phasic triggers, you should also consider **when** to send them in your PsychoPy drawing cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immediate**:  \n",
    "   - Sends the trigger the moment the code line is executed.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Logic-based events or key presses not tied to a screen refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **On-Flip**:  \n",
    "   - Schedules the trigger for the **next screen refresh** (`win.flip()` in PsychoPy).  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Visual stimulus presentation requiring frame-level synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an ERP study analyzing response latency might need triggers that **exactly coincide** with a new stimulus. In that case, an on-flip trigger is recommended to ensure **frame-locked accuracy**. Conversely, a logic-based marker (like “participant pressed spacebar”) can be sent immediately without referencing the display refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Opening and Managing the Serial Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the COM Port**:  \n",
    "   Find the USB-to-serial port name (e.g., `COM3`, `/dev/ttyUSB0`).\n",
    "2. **Initialize and Reset**:  \n",
    "   It is a best practice to **open** the serial port early in your script and **reset** the trigger line to 0 immediately, ensuring a clean starting state.\n",
    "3. **Confirm Specs**:  \n",
    "   Some EEG amplifiers require a minimum pulse width or specific baud rate. Check DSI-24 documentation to confirm the recommended serial settings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice**: If your code is in PsychoPy, place serial initialization in a “Begin Experiment” tab or at the start of your script to ensure it’s ready by the time you start sending triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Additional Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistent Coding Scheme**  \n",
    "   - Use a clear, documented mapping of triggers (e.g., `START_TASK = 10`, `GO_ONSET = 1`, etc.) so you can easily interpret them later.\n",
    "2. **Resetting Tonic Triggers**  \n",
    "   - Always remember to **reset** tonic triggers back to `0` (or another baseline) after the condition ends.\n",
    "3. **Timing Requirements**  \n",
    "   - Check the **minimum pulse width** for phasic triggers. Some hardware requires at least 10 ms for proper detection.  \n",
    "4. **Logging and Verification**  \n",
    "   - Print console messages or log to file whenever you send a trigger. This helps with debugging and ensures your DSI-24 is receiving codes as expected.\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Approach**  \n",
    "   - If your experiment has **long blocks** plus **precise events** within those blocks, consider combining a tonic marker for the block with **phasic** pulses for sub-events.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding **tonic vs. phasic** triggers and carefully selecting **immediate vs. on-flip** timing, you can precisely align your DSI-24 EEG data with the events that matter most in your experiment. Whether you’re running a simple reaction-time task or a complex neurofeedback study, consistently applying these concepts will yield more reliable and interpretable EEG results.\n",
