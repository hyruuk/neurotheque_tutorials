    "# Setting up Event Markers (Triggers) for Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In many EEG or physiological experiments, it’s crucial to **mark** task events using “triggers” (also called **event markers**). By sending numeric codes to your recording system, you can synchronize recorded signals with specific experimental conditions or participant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates **two main approaches** for sending triggers:\n",
    "1. **Phasic Triggers**: Short pulses at key moments (e.g., stimulus onset, button press).  \n",
    "2. **Tonic Triggers**: Holding a trigger line “high” for the duration of an event (then manually resetting).\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use a **Go/No-Go** task example (uploaded to [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org/)) to demonstrate how you might embed these triggers into your PsychoPy code. Note that while we showcase **Go/No-Go**, the same principles apply to **any** task requiring event markers.\n",

    "### 1.2 Tonic vs. Phasic Triggers: When to Use Which?\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting up your serial port connection (section 1.1), the next step is to decide **how** you want to send triggers to your EEG/physiology device. Generally, you have **two** main styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tonic (Sustained) Triggers**\n",
    "2. **Phasic (Transient) Triggers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a more detailed overview of when each strategy is preferred, with references to common research practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 Tonic (Sustained) Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Is It?**  \n",
    "- You set the trigger line to a nonzero value at the **start** of an event/condition, keep it high **throughout** that event, and then **manually reset** it to 0 at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Use Cases**  \n",
    "1. **Long-Duration Conditions**  \n",
    "   - For instance, if your experiment has blocks of trials (e.g., 2-minute blocks of task vs. 2-minute blocks of rest) and you want your EEG data to reflect which block is active.  \n",
    "   - Tonic markers help you see, in the raw data, a continuous “high” value that indicates “Block A” is ongoing versus “Block B.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-Step or Complex Events**  \n",
    "   - In some paradigms, you might have a longer “trial” with sub-events. You might hold a *tonic* trigger for the entire trial, then also send **phasic** pulses within that trial for specific sub-events.  \n",
    "   - Example: In a working memory task, you raise a tonic trigger for “encoding phase” and only lower it after the final recall response is done.\n",
    "3. **Neurofeedback or Real-Time Applications**  \n",
    "   - Some real-time or closed-loop systems need a continuous “state” marker to know if the subject is in a “trial” vs. “rest” phase. A tonic trigger can facilitate that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**  \n",
    "- **Clear in the data**: You can visually see in the raw EEG/physio signals that “the experiment was in condition X” from time A to time B.  \n",
    "- **Simplicity**: For truly extended events, it can be simpler to just set once at onset and reset at offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**  \n",
    "- **Risk of forgetting to reset**: If you leave the trigger high, you might confuse subsequent phases or events.  \n",
    "- **Less precise** for short or frequent events inside that sustained period.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advice**  \n",
    "- Use tonic triggers when you specifically want a **continuous** marker in the EEG/physio record, or when your block/condition is distinctly separate in time and you do not need to mark sub-events with the same line.  \n",
    "- If your design also requires marking **shorter** sub-events within the same block, consider **combining** a tonic trigger (for the entire block) with **phasic** triggers (for each sub-event).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.2 Phasic (Transient) Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Is It?**  \n",
    "- You write a nonzero value for only a **brief** period (often 10–50 ms) at the **exact moment** something happens (e.g., stimulus onset, subject response), and then reset to 0 immediately afterward (or automatically after the short duration).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Use Cases**  \n",
    "1. **Discrete Stimulus Onsets**  \n",
    "   - Most common in classic ERP (Event-Related Potential) studies: each stimulus onset is marked by a short pulse so you can epoch the EEG data precisely around that time.  \n",
    "   - E.g., P300 paradigms often rely on phasic triggers to time-lock the onset of an oddball stimulus.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Responses or Rapid Sequences of Events**  \n",
    "   - Whenever multiple triggers might occur **close together**—for example, if you have a fast-paced task with many short stimuli or responses.  \n",
    "   - Phasic pulses ensure each event is distinctly marked without overlap.\n",
    "3. **Short-Lived States**  \n",
    "   - If you have an event that lasts only a few milliseconds or tens of milliseconds (e.g., a flash or a beep), a phasic trigger can align tightly with that ephemeral event.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**  \n",
    "- **High temporal precision**: Perfect for analyzing latencies in ERPs, reaction times, etc.  \n",
    "- **Minimal risk of overlap**: Because it resets to 0 quickly, you won’t accidentally obscure subsequent triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**  \n",
    "- **Not well-suited to representing a sustained state**: You cannot just look at raw data and see “the line is high the whole time.”  \n",
    "- If your hardware or software requires a certain **minimum** pulse length (e.g., at least 10 ms) to register, you have to ensure your phasic duration is long enough to be reliably detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advice**  \n",
    "- Use phasic triggers if you want **clean, discrete** event markers for time-locking in your data analysis (ERP or other trial-based analyses).  \n",
    "- Double-check your hardware’s **minimum pulse width** requirements. Many EEG amplifiers reliably detect pulses as short as 5–10 ms, but some might need 20–50 ms to register.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.3 Additional Literature-Based Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clinical/Neuropsychological** tasks (e.g., oddball paradigms, CNV tasks) typically rely on **phasic** pulses for each stimulus or trial event, because analysis focuses on event-locked potentials.  \n",
    "- **Longer neurofeedback** or **block-based** designs (e.g., fMRI block designs adapted to EEG) might use **tonic** triggers to denote each block’s start/end.  \n",
    "- **Multi-level** tasks can combine both: a **tonic** marker to indicate which “block” or “task condition” is active, plus **phasic** markers for each stimulus/response within that block.  \n",
    "- In **rapid-serial-visual-presentation** (RSVP) studies, **phasic** markers are vital for each item in the stream (since items appear quickly), but if you have a top-level block or condition, you might also add a tonic marker for that block.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.4 Deciding Which Method to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment Duration & Structure**  \n",
    "  - If your event or condition lasts a significant portion of time (seconds to minutes) and you want your data to reflect that entire period as distinct from the rest, consider a **tonic** marker.  \n",
    "  - If you have rapid, frequent events where you only need to know **exact** onset times, **phasic** pulses are typically the standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analysis Requirements**  \n",
    "  - For **ERP or time-locked** analyses: short, discrete triggers (phasic) are typically essential.  \n",
    "  - For identifying **global states** (like “this block is a dual-task condition,” “that block is single-task,” etc.), a tonic approach helps highlight block boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hardware Considerations**  \n",
    "  - Some systems need a minimum trigger width (e.g., 5–10 ms). If you go too short, the device might miss it.  \n",
    "  - If using a tonic trigger, be absolutely sure to reset it—some recording systems can interpret repeated “high” states incorrectly if not managed well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.5 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tonic** = *Sustained*, indicating a condition that persists for a significant duration.  \n",
    "- **Phasic** = *Short pulses*, precisely time-locked to important, **momentary** events.  \n",
    "- **Combination** = Use **tonic** for broad phases (like block-level markers) and **phasic** for **specific within-block** triggers (like stimulus onsets or responses).\n",
    "\n",
    "By reviewing the typical usage in EEG/physiology studies and referencing well-known paradigms (ERP tasks, block-based designs, etc.), you can select the approach—or **mix** of approaches—that best fits your experimental design and analysis goals.\n",

    "### 1.3 Immediate vs. On-Flip Trigger Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the question of **which** trigger style (tonic or phasic) you need (section 1.2), there’s also the matter of **when** you want the trigger to fire in your PsychoPy code. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immediate**: The trigger is sent the moment your code executes that line.  \n",
    "2. **On-Flip**: The trigger is scheduled to fire precisely at the **next screen refresh** (`win.flip()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this matter? In EEG and psychophysics, you often want to **synchronize** your triggers with **visual events**. If your display updates at a certain frame, sending a trigger “immediately” may not perfectly align with that visual onset. Conversely, if the trigger is not tied to any visual event (e.g., it’s only marking an internal logic change or a participant’s key press), an immediate trigger might suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.1 Immediate Trigger Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "**When do they happen?**  \n",
    "They occur exactly at the line in your code where you call the trigger function—there’s no waiting for a screen refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**  \n",
    "- **Non-visual events** or purely logic-based changes. For instance, sending a trigger to mark the moment a key press is detected, or when your code transitions from one internal state to another.  \n",
    "- If the event you’re marking doesn’t need to coincide with a **stimulus flip**, an immediate call is straightforward and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Immediately send a short (phasic) trigger to mark a key press\n",
    "if 'space' in key_resp.keys:\n",
    "    send_trigger_phasic(ser, 10, dur=0.01)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.2 On-Flip Trigger Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "**When do they happen?**  \n",
    "At the **next screen refresh**—the moment `win.flip()` executes in PsychoPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**  \n",
    "- **Frame-locked** or **stimulus-locked** events: When you need a trigger to coincide precisely with a new stimulus appearing on screen. This is crucial in EEG studies requiring exact alignment with stimulus onset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def turn_trigger_on():\n",
    "    ser.write(str.encode(chr(20)))  # e.g., trigger value 20\n",
    "    print(\"Trigger 20 sent at screen flip\")\n",
    "win.callOnFlip(turn_trigger_on)\n",
    "win.flip()\n",
    "core.wait(0.05)  # hold for 50 ms if phasic\n",
    "ser.write(str.encode(chr(0)))  # reset line back to 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the trigger sets to value 20 exactly when the screen buffers swap, meaning the participant sees the new stimulus and the EEG marker changes in the same instant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ideal for precise synchronization of triggers with visual updates (critical for many ERP studies).\n",
    "- Reduces timing jitter associated with uncertain code execution times.\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Slightly more complex approach (function scheduling + the actual flip).\n",
    "- If you forget to call win.flip(), the trigger won’t fire at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.3 Choosing the Optimal Timing Approach\n",
    "1. **Immediate**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simpler for marking background logic, user responses, or anything not explicitly tied to the next screen refresh.\n",
    "- Slightly less precise for visual onset, but sufficient if you don’t need strict frame-locking.\n",
    "2. **On-Flip**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Essential if your stimulus onset marker must match the exact frame the participant sees the stimulus.\n",
    "- The standard in tasks where accurate time-locking is mandatory (e.g., ERP paradigms).\n",
    "- Many experiments employ both methods: on-flip triggers for controlling stimulus presentation alignment, and immediate triggers for user responses or internal transitions.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, you’ve learned about **tonic vs. phasic** triggers (section 1.2) and **immediate vs. on-flip** timing (section 1.3). In this final section, we’ll provide **ready-to-use** PsychoPy functions that let you combine these concepts in practice. You can copy and paste these into your experiment script to send event markers via the serial port.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of These Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phasic Triggers**  \n",
    "   - **`send_trigger_phasic`**: Sends a brief (e.g. 10–50 ms) pulse immediately.  \n",
    "   - **`send_trigger_onflip_phasic`**: Same brief pulse, but scheduled at the next screen flip.  \n",
    "2. **Tonic Triggers**  \n",
    "   - **`send_trigger_tonic`**: Sets the line to a nonzero value and **holds** it until manually reset.  \n",
    "   - **`reset_trigger_tonic`**: Resets a tonic trigger back to 0.  \n",
    "   - **`send_trigger_onflip`**: Schedules a tonic trigger to begin at the next screen flip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these functions give you fine-grained control: you can either fire your marker right away or wait until the precise moment the stimulus appears on-screen, and you can choose whether that marker is a short pulse (phasic) or stays “on” until you reset it (tonic).\n",
