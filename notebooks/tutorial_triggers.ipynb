    "# Setting up Event Markers (Triggers) for Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In many EEG or physiological experiments, it’s crucial to **mark** task events using “triggers” or “event markers.” By sending numeric codes to your recording system, you can synchronize recorded signals with specific experimental conditions or participant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on **two main approaches** for sending triggers:\n",
    "1. **Phasic Triggers** – Short pulses at key moments (e.g., stimulus onset, button press).\n",
    "2. **Tonic Triggers** – Holding a trigger high for the duration of an event (or a longer time window).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide a **Go/No-Go** task example (uploaded to [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org/)) to show exactly how you might insert these triggers into your PsychoPy code modules. Although this tutorial highlights **Go/No-Go**, the same principles apply to **any** task needing triggers.\n"

    "### 1.2 Tonic vs. Phasic Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tonic**: Keep a nonzero trigger value “high” for the duration of an event. You manually reset it to 0 at the end.  \n",
    "- **Phasic**: Send a brief pulse (e.g., 10–50 ms) exactly at the moment of interest, then automatically return to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which approach to use?**  \n",
    "- **Phasic** is typically best for discrete or momentary events (such as stimulus onset or a button press). It ensures precise time-locking and avoids leaving the trigger “on” too long.  \n",
    "- **Tonic** can represent a continuous state (for example, while a stimulus is displayed), then you reset at the event’s conclusion. This is useful if you need the trigger to remain high throughout an entire condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 send_trigger vs. send_trigger_onflip\n",
    "\n",
    "In many PsychoPy experiments, you need to synchronize triggers with visual (or other) stimuli. Specifically, **when** you send the trigger can be critical:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`send_trigger`**:  \n",
    "   - Sends a short pulse **immediately** upon function call.  \n",
    "   - It does **not** wait for a screen refresh. Instead, the trigger goes out at whatever point in time the code is executed.  \n",
    "   - This is perfect if you have an event that isn’t strictly tied to a stimulus flip, or if you want to send a trigger for something that happens asynchronously (like a response event or a condition changing in the background).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`send_trigger_onflip`**:  \n",
    "   - Schedules the trigger to turn **on** right at the next **screen refresh** (`win.flip()`), holds it for a specified duration, and then resets it to 0.  \n",
    "   - This is crucial if you want the trigger timestamp to line up exactly with the moment a stimulus appears on screen. Psychophysics and EEG/physiology experiments often require you to send the marker at the **precise** frame when the stimulus is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Which?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `send_trigger`**:\n",
    "  - For events that aren’t locked to visual presentation (e.g., subject responses, intermediate states, or sending a marker at an arbitrary time in your experiment flow).  \n",
    "  - If you just want a quick, blocking pulse that doesn’t depend on `win.flip()` scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `send_trigger_onflip`**:\n",
    "  - When you need the trigger to coincide with the exact moment the screen updates.  \n",
    "  - Commonly used for marking **stimulus onset**, ensuring your EEG/physiological data lines up with the frame the participant sees the stimulus for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the **complete code** for both functions, along with docstrings explaining their usage for **phasic** and **tonic** approaches:\n"
